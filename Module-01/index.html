<h1>Web mapping</h1>
    <p>This is the beginning of my long and wonderful journey into JavaScript programming and mapping.</p>
    <h2>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>
    <p>I found the overall content of this essay very thought provoking. I think Robinson has an idealistic view of mapping, but Harley has a more realistic one in that we may try to produce unbiased maps, but that our personal biases will always peak through. My goal is to use the critical thought process of Harley to produce maps that fit Robinson’s idealistic view. That being said I would say that I probably identify mostly with that of the cartographer, with the critic as a close second. I have a strong desire to produce things that are aesthetically pleasing and functional. I am constantly editing formats and design in an effort to convey messages in the simplest form possible without losing the overall point I’m trying to convey. Coding and its’ subsequent products allows me to fine tune my critiques and implement the design and function I envision in my head. Overall, I want to ensure that my maps are functional, visually appealing, and most of all correct. These priorities will guide my thought process throughout my map making career.

Number 5 of the manifesto was probably the most proactive to me. The case made is one that could be made for just about anything. Data can have good and bad applications, and it’s about the intentions of those wielding that information, not the raw material itself. I agree it is something to be considered when taking on a new venture, but it can’t be the end all be all of the conversation. The example given was more of a case of purposely misleading a population to give up data without understanding who would be hosting that data. The pretense used to persuade them however was not without merit.
